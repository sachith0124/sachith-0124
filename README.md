My name is Sachith(@sachith-0124)! 

I am a DataScience Grad Student at Texas A&M University, with an undergrad degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 👨‍🎓

I have a combined work experience of 2+ years in Web Developement and Data Science. 💼

I am interested in building cool new stuff with data and clever algorithms! 💫

I am currently looking for any internship starting Spring '23 or a full time offer starting May '23.
